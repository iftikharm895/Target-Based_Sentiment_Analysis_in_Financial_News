# Leveraging Large Language Models for Target-Specific Sentiment Analysis in Financial News

## üìå Project Overview
This research advances target-based financial sentiment analysis (TBFSA) by evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot / few-shot learning paradigms. We benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs against traditional approaches: 

| Category | Models |
|----------|--------|
| **LLMs** | GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, Gemma-2-9B, Gemma-2-27B |
| **Fine-Tune Transformer-Based Models** | FinBERT, FinBERT-Tone, DistilFinRoBERTa, DeBERTa v3-base-ABSA-V1.1 |
| **Lexicon-Based Methods** | VADER, TextBlob |

## üìÇ Dataset Discription
The dataset contains financial news articles about major stock companies (Alphabet, Amazon, Netflix, Nvidia) collected from the Bloomberg Terminal. Each article was manually annotated by three annotators for: 1.**Target Entity Identification** 2. **Target-Specific Sentiment Labeling**  
### Dataset Structure:
#### Format: CSV  
#### Columns:  
o	Publishing Date: Article publication date  
o	Publishing Time: Article publication time  
o ID: Unique news article identifier  
o	Target: The company to which the sentiment analysis applies.   
o	URL: The direct link to the full news article  
o	Manual: The manually assigned sentiment score (-1 = Negative, 0 = Neutral, +1 = Positive) reflects the evaluated sentiment toward the target
